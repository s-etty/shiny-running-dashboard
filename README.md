# Running Dashboard Using Shiny

The goal of this project is to learn how to create Shiny apps, deploy them using [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), store user data with a remote storage solution, and see my running progress.

## Skills Used in this Repo

- Shiny
- NoSQL

## References, Resources, and Learning

Of course, as this is a new skill for me, I will be using a lot of resources to learn and build this app. It's very important to me that credit is given; I am not creating this in a vacuum.
